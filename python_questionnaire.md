# üìù Python Practice Questionnaire

This questionnaire covers **Arithmetic & Operators (1‚Äì25)** and **String Operations (26‚Äì50)**.  
It includes coding tasks, output predictions, and conceptual questions.

---

## Section A: Arithmetic & Operators (1‚Äì25)

1. Write a Python program to add two numbers entered by the user.  
   - Example Input: `4, 7`  
   - Example Output: `11`

2. If `a = 15` and `b = 8`, what will `a - b` return?  

3. Multiply two floating-point numbers entered by the user and display the result.  

4. What is the difference between `/` and `//` in Python? Demonstrate with an example.  

5. Write a program to find the remainder when `a = 29` is divided by `b = 5`.  

6. Explain **exponentiation** (`**`) in Python with an example program.  

7. What does floor division (`//`) do when dividing negative numbers? Example: `-7 // 2`  

8. What is the output of `17 % 3` and why?  

9. Write a program to calculate the **average of three numbers** entered by the user.  

10. Write a program to calculate the **square** and **cube** of a number.  

11. Write a program to calculate the **area of a circle** when radius = `7`. (Use œÄ = 3.14)  

12. What is the purpose of variable **swapping**? Write a program to swap two variables without using a third variable.  

13. Predict the output:  
    ```python
    n = 5
    n += 1
    print(n)
    ```  

14. Write a program that decrements a number entered by the user.  

15. What is the difference between `n *= 2` and `n = n * 2`?  

16. If `n = 50`, what will be the output of:  
    ```python
    n /= 2
    print(n)
    ```  

17. Write a program to print the **negative** of a number entered by the user.  

18. How can you calculate the **absolute value** of a number without using `abs()` in Python?  

19. A student scored 40 out of 50 in a test. Write a program to calculate the **percentage**.  

20. Write a program to calculate the **circumference of a circle** for radius = `14`.  

21. Identify the error in this program and correct it:  
    ```python
    print(int(input("Exponent: ")) * 10)
    ```  
    (It was intended to calculate **10 to the power of exponent**).  

22. Write a program to convert a string input `"123"` into integer and add `5`.  

23. Convert a floating-point number (e.g., `12.98`) entered by the user into an integer.  

24. Write a program that accepts three numbers and prints their **sum**.  

25. What will be the output of this code?  
    ```python
    print(5 // 2)
    print(5 / 2)
    print(5 % 2)
    ```

## Section B: String Operations (26‚Äì50)

26. Write a program to find the **length** of a string entered by the user.  

27. Write a program to **concatenate** two strings entered by the user.  

28. If the input string is `"Hi"`, what will be the output of `print("Hi" * 3)`?  

29. Convert a string `"python"` into **uppercase** and `"HELLO"` into **lowercase**.  

30. What will be the output of `"PyThOn".swapcase()`?  

31. Write a program to display a string in **title case**.  

32. Write a program to count how many times a substring `"is"` occurs in `"This is island"`.  

33. Write a program to find the index of substring `"cat"` in `"concatenate"`.  

34. Write a program to check whether an input string is numeric (`isdigit()`).  

35. Differentiate between `isalpha()` and `isalnum()` with examples.  

36. Predict the output:  
    ```python
    print("  python  ".strip())
    ```  

37. Write a program to remove only the **leading spaces** from a string.  

38. Write a program to remove only the **trailing spaces** from a string.  

39. Write a program that centers the string `"Hi"` inside 10 characters.  

40. Write a program that left-justifies and right-justifies a string `"Hello"` within width 10.  

41. Write a program that partitions the string `"Hello-World"` using separator `"-"`.  

42. Write a program to split the string `"one two three"` into a list of words.  

43. Write a program to join the words `["one", "two", "three"]` with a dash `"-"`.  

44. Replace `"apple"` with `"orange"` in the string `"I like apple"`.  

45. Write a program to count the **number of vowels** in a string.  

46. Write a program to count the **number of consonants** in a string.  

47. Predict the output:  
    ```python
    print("Python"[::-1])
    ```  

48. What is the difference between `find()` and `count()` in strings? Give examples.  

49. Write a program to reverse an input string using slicing.  

50. Which string methods would you use to:  
    - Convert to uppercase  
    - Remove extra spaces  
    - Count occurrences of `"a"`
