## Section B — Very Short Answers

3. Write a function `is_anagram(s1, s2)` that returns `True` if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams (case-insensitive). Provide only the function.

4. Given `a = [1,2,3,4]` and `b = [3,4,5]`, write one-line Python code (do NOT use `set()`) to produce the intersection list preserving order: `[3,4]`.

5. Write a function `sum_first_n_odds(n)` that returns the sum of the first `n` odd numbers using a loop (do not use formula).

6. Check if a list is sorted in ascending order.

### Section C - Long Answers

7. Text Analyzer

   Write a function `analyze_text(s)` that takes a string `s` (a paragraph) and returns a dictionary with counts:
   `{'vowels': .., 'consonants': .., 'digits': .., 'spaces': ..}`. Consider vowels = a,e,i,o,u (case-insensitive); count only alphabetic consonants as consonants.

8. Employee Salary Processing.
`emp = [ ["E1", 10000], ["E2", 20000] ]`. Print names of employees with Salary > 15000.

9. Marks: `m = [10, 20, 30]`.
a) Sum.
b) Average.
c) Max.

10. Count the length of a string without using ```len()``` function.
